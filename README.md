## About<a name = "about"></a>
The public URL for this website is [https://personal-dashboard-x8hx.onrender.com/](https://personal-dashboard-x8hx.onrender.com/).

Overall, all of the functionality is complete as well as the styling. There are a few things that I would have liked to add but unfortunately run out of time.
